The folder contains 3 classifier models using different approaches.
1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Tree
3. Neural Network 
There are 3 different classifiers for this task: naive bayes, decision tree and a sophisticated model using Neural networks. 
Learning curve would appear for decision tree and naive bayes. Close the plots to view the accuracies.

To run simply type python Prompt.py
